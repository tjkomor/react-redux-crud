This is a basic CRUD application that uses React and Redux. You will be able to add/delete/edit users,
without having to reload the page. If you choose to reload the browser at any point, the data will not persist.

After cloning the repository, run npm install and then npm start to start the application. Once you have run npm start, navigate to localhost:3000/index.
